1.0.12

1.0.10

1.0.9

1.0.8
~~~~~
- Allow writing version 2 files (Large Files).

1.0.7
~~~~~
- Removed reads from asserts to allow PYTHONOPTIMIZE.

1.0.6
~~~~~
- Allows zero-length record variables.

1.0.5
~~~~~
- Added the option to open files without using mmap, since mmap can't handle huge files on Windows.

1.0.4
~~~~~
- Fixed packing of dimensions when writing a file. The order was being read from a dictionary (essentially unordered), instead of from the list with the proper order.

1.0.3
~~~~~
- Fixed bug so that it can write scalar variables.

1.0.2
~~~~~
- Fixed broken 1.0.1, ``var.shape`` was returning the current number of records in the first dimension, breaking the detection of record variables.

1.0.1
~~~~~
- Changed the code to read the variable shape from the underlying data object.

1.0.0
~~~~~
- Initial stable release. Handles record arrays properly (using a single mmap for all record variables) and writes files.
